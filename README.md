# Regularized Neural Detection for Millimeter Wave Massive MIMO Communication Systems with One-bit ADCs

## About the Project

Our project addresses the challenge of multi-user massive MIMO signal detection from one-bit received measurements, with a specific emphasis on the intricacies of the wireless channel. While many existing approaches concentrate on detector design for rich-scattering, homogeneous Rayleigh fading channels, we introduce a novel approach for detecting signals in the context of lower diversity millimeter-wave (mmWave) channels.

### Key Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

#### 1. Parametric Deep Learning System

We have developed the **mmW-ROBNet**, which is a parametric deep learning system designed to enhance signal detection in mmWave channels.

#### 2. Constellation-Aware Loss Function

We have devised a specialized loss function that is **constellation-aware**, enabling more accurate and effective signal detection.

#### 3. Hierarchical Detection Training Strategy
We implement a **hierarchical training strategy** to enhance the signal detection process.


### mmW-ROBNet

The mmW-ROBNet is the key contribution of this project. Here's a brief summary of its features:

- **Unfolded DNN Algorithm:** The mmW-ROBNet is developed as an approach to solve constrained optimizations for general channel matrices via a DNN-augmented GD algorithm.

- **Channel-Specific Design:** The mmW-ROBNet framework incorporates the specific properties of the mmWave channel, making it suitable for the unique challenges of mmWave communications.

- **T-Stage Regularized GD:** The framework unfolds a T-stage regularized GD algorithm into T distinct sub-networks, each represented as a stage.

- **OBMNet Iteration:** At the beginning of each stage, the OBMNet iteration generates gradients and outputs, contributing to the signal detection process.

- **User-Matched Gradient:** The mmWave-channel powers per user are matched to the OBMNet-generated gradient, improving the accuracy of signal detection.

- **Regularization Network:** A regularization network fine-tunes the previous estimates, user-matched gradients, and OBMNet outputs.



## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) version 1.12 or higher.
  - You can download PyTorch from the official [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/pytorch/pytorch) (e.g., pytorch/pytorch:1.12.1-cuda11.3-cudnn8-runtime).
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting

You can install NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib using pip:

```shell
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib


- **Stage-Dependent Correction:** A residual link from the OBMNet output corrects the unconstrained OBMNet step in a stage-dependent manner.

- **Normalization:** The final output is normalized to ensure effective signal detection.
