# Regularized Neural Detection for Millimeter Wave Massive MIMO Communication Systems with One-bit ADCs

## About the Project

Our project addresses the challenge of multi-user massive MIMO signal detection from one-bit received measurements, with a specific emphasis on the intricacies of the wireless channel. While many existing approaches concentrate on detector design for rich-scattering, homogeneous Rayleigh fading channels, we introduce a novel approach for detecting signals in the context of lower diversity millimeter-wave (mmWave) channels.

### Key Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

#### 1. Parametric Deep Learning System

We have developed the **mmW-ROBNet**, which is a parametric deep learning system designed to enhance signal detection in mmWave channels.

#### 2. Constellation-Aware Loss Function

We have devised a specialized loss function that is **constellation-aware**, enabling more accurate and effective signal detection.

#### 3. Hierarchical Detection Training Strategy
We implement a **hierarchical training strategy** to enhance the signal detection process.
